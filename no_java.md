# Why You Shouldn't Use Java

* Java copied all syntax from C++. Although this does not make it bad, it shows
  how the developers are not willing to add new features.
* Java is slow. In my tests, it runs 2-3x slower than C++. This is a big difference,
  and can mean running for a whole workday rather than a few hours.
* Java lacks useful features. There is no control of pointers, references, and there
  are no low level operations in Java. It is even missing unsigned integer types!
* Everything must be a class. A class defines the memory layout of an abstract concept,
  optionally with functions that are tied to the class (methods). If you need to group
  members together, a namespace is more intuitive, rather than a class.
* Java is less flexible. If you need speed, use C++, which also provides more features. If
  you need pre-written libraries, use Python.

If you are in a course which teaches Java, I highly recommend you learn C++ and/or Python
on the side so you finish the class with useful skills.
