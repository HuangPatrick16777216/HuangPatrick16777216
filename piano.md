# Piano Music

I am an amateur pianist, and I study by myself.
However, I could not have achieved my current level without the help of my teachers.

I am practicing these pieces:

* Beethoven: Sonata No. 17 Tempest, 3rd movement
* Chopin: Ballade 4
* Chopin: Nocturne Op. 27 No. 2
* Rachmaninoff: Etude Op. 39 No. 6 Little Red Riding Hood
* Scarlatti: Sonata K.27 in b minor

Pieces I will practice in the future:

* Ravel: Gaspard de la Nuit
* Chopin: Ballade 1
* Chopin: Nocturne*
* Liszt: Feux Follets
* Liszt: Paganini/Liszt No. 3
* Liszt: Paganini/Liszt No. 6

Significant pieces that I have completed (may revisit in the future):

* Chopstix
* Chopin: Etude Op. 10 No. 5
* Mozart: Piano Sonata No. 8
* Bach: Prelude & Fugue No. 2
* Liszt: Hungarian Rhapsody 2
* Liszt: Mazeppa
