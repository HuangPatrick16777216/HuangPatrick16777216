# Piano Music

I am an amateur pianist, and I study by myself.
However, I could not have achieved my current level without the help of my teachers.

I am practicing these pieces:

* Liszt: Mazeppa
* Liszt: Hungarian Rhapsody 2
* Chopin: Etude Op. 25 No. 6
* Chopin: Etude Op. 25 No. 9

Pieces I will practice in the future:

* Ravel: Gaspard de la Nuit
* Chopin: Ballade 1
* Chopin: Ballade 4
* Liszt: Feux Follets

Significant pieces that I have completed:

* Chopstix
* Chopin: Etude Op. 10 No. 5
* Mozart: Piano Sonata No. 8
* Bach: Prelude & Fugue No. 2
* Liszt: Un Sospiro
