# My Opinion on the GNU/Linux Naming Controversy

## Background

GNU is a completely free (freedom) operating system started by Richard Stallman in 1983.
In 1991, Linus Torvalds released Linux as free software, and GNU and Linux together formed a
completely free operating system.

Today, GNU and Linux are used together with many other free packages, like X, GNOME, Firefox,
VSCode. These components still form a free operating system, but the naming is unclear because
the operating system is made of many independent components.

Richard Stallman proposes the name GNU/Linux because GNU started the system, and Linux was added.
However, most people today call the complete system Linux.

## My Opinion

I propose we call the whole system Linux. While it is true that the Linux kernel only is
a small amount of the total source code, it wouldn't be fair to only give credit to GNU and
Linux in the name. I would say that I use Firefox and VSCode much more than most GNU utilities
everyday, so why not call it GNU/Linux/Firefox/VSCode? Not to mention the GNOME window manager
which is running constantly and allows me to interact with these packages easily.

In order to arrive at a "good" name, we need one that:

1. Applies to all users of the free operating system.
2. Is not too long.
3. Gives appropriate credit.
4. Is recognizable
5. Is easily usable.

"Linux" is short and applies to all users of the free operating system. What makes the Linux
component different from other components is that the system needs Linux to function. If you
remove GCC or VSCode, the system will still work (though it may work less).

Yes, it is true that GNU started everything and wrote many utilities that makes countless projects
possible, so you can argue that we should call the system "GNU" or "GNU/Linux". However, "GNU" does
not fit requirement 4, and "GNU/Linux" does not fit requirement 5 (imagine a project where
the os name can only have alphanumeric characters).

In conclusion, while I call the system "Linux", I will always educate others on the true origin
whenever appropriate. This fits all the requirements, and also allows more people to learn about GNU.
